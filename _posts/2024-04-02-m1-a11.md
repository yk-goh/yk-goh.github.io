# 1. house 데이터에 적용한 linear regression, 선형 SVM, 그리고 RANSAC에 의해 추정된 선형모형을 제시하고, RANSAC(outlier가 제거된 OLS 선형모형)과의 비교를 통해 linear regression 모형과 SVM을 설명하는 예제
- RANSAC은 robust 회귀이므로 RANSAC의 회귀계수와 linear regression의 회귀계수를 비교하면 어떤 특성변수에 outlier가 있는지 확인할 수 있다.
    - 회귀계수의 차이가 큰 특성변수에 outlier가 있다
- 마찬가지로 RANSAC 회귀계수와 선형 SVM 회귀계수를 비교하여 어떤 특성변수가 outlier의 영향을 크게 받았는지 유추할 수 있다
- RANSAC-SVM의 회귀계수 차이가 RANSAC-linear의 회귀계수 차이보다 작으므로, **SVM이 linear보다 outlier에 대한 저항성이 크다고 할 수 있다**
- <p style="color:gray">outlier가 있으면 MSE 비교는 큰 의미가 없다. 단지, training 데이터의 MSE에 비해 test 데이터의 MSE가 지나치게 크면 linear regression에서는 outlier를 의심해야 한다. <br> RANSAC도 같은 현상이 일어날 수 있다. 데이터 크기가 작으면 RANSAC의 성능이 좋지 않기 때문이다.</p>

# NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
# RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
# AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
# DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
# RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
# TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
# PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
# B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
# LSTAT - % lower status of the population

RANSAC 회귀는 outlier가 제거된 consensus set에 적합하는 회귀이므로 outlier의 영향을 크게 받지 않는다. RANSAC은 이상치가 제거된 OLS 선형모형이라 할 수 있으므로, RANSAC 회귀계수와 linear regression 및 선형 SVM의 회귀계수를 비교함으로써 어떤 특성변수가 outlier의 영향을 크게 받았는지 확인할 수 있다.

1\) RANSAC 회귀계수와 linear regression 회귀계수 비교
- RANSAC과 linear regression의 회귀계수를 비교하면, 네 번째 특성변수와 열 두번째 특성변수가 다른 특성변수 대비 큰 차이를 보인다. 이상치의 영향을 크게 받았음을 짐작할 수 있다. 

2\) RANSAC 회귀계수와 선형 SVM 회귀계수 비교
- RANSAC과 선형 SVM 회귀의 회귀계수를 비교하면, 앞선 1\)과 유사하게 네 번째 특성변수가 다른 특성변수 대비 큰 차이를 보여 이상치의 영향을 크게 받았음을 짐작할 수 있다. 

3\) RANSAC-SVM의 회귀계수 차이가 RANSAC-linear의 회귀계수 차이보다 전반적으로 작으므로, 선형 SVM 회귀가 linear regression보다 outlier에 대한 저항성이 크다고 할 수 있다.

# 2. house 데이터에 적용된 SVM에서 epsilon의 역할
- epsilon은 튜브의 너비를 결정한다. 2×ε이 튜브의 너비이며, 이 안에 위치하는 관측치는 회귀선을 결정하는 계산에 영향을 미치지 못한다. 계산에 기여하는 것은 튜브의 양 경계선에 위치하거나 그보다 멀리 떨어진 관측치이며, 이것을 서포트벡터라고 칭한다. 
- SVM회귀에서 epsilon이 커지면 튜브가 점차 많은 영역을 커버하므로 서포트벡터의 수가 줄어들어 회귀계수 추정에 기여하는 관측치가 줄어든다. 그러므로 지나치게 큰 epsilon은 과소적합(underfit)의 원인이 된다. 반대로, epsilon이 작아지면 튜브의 너비가 좁아지므로 서포트벡터의 수가 증가한다. 이는 모델이 training data에 과대적합(overfit) 되는 원인이 되므로 적절한 epsilon 값을 찾는 것이 중요하다.
