# wine_data를 이용하여 <span style="color:gold">logistic, SVM, CART</span> 모형을 적합하고 <span style="color:gold">nested cross validation</span>을 적용하여 최선의 모형을 산출하기

> 실제 데이터 분석에서는 train set을 GridSearchCV에 적용하여 최상의 초모수를 구한 후, train set의 accuracy(loss)를 nested cross-validation에 의해 구한 test set의 평균 accuracy(loss)와 비교하여 overfit 여부를 판단하고, test set의 평균 accuracy(loss)가 해당 모형의 성능이 된다

#### step 1. wine_data의 목적변수와 특성변수를 확인하고 train set과 test set으로 나눈다.


```python
# wine data 불러오기 
import pandas as pd
dat_wine=pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/'
                     'wine/wine.data',header=None) 

# Label Encoding 
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
X = dat_wine.iloc[:,1:].values
y = dat_wine.iloc[:,0].values
le = LabelEncoder() # instantiation
y = le.fit_transform(y)

# le.classes_
# le.transform([1,2,3]) # 1,2,3 클래스가 0,1,2로 전환됨 

# train test split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.3, random_state=1,stratify=y)

dat_wine.head()
```

#### step 2. logistic, SVM, CART 모형을 적합하기 위해 각 클래스의 파라미터 키를 확인한다.
로지스틱 회귀의 경우 중요한 초모수가 ‘C’, ‘penalty’, ‘max_iter’로 보인다. (penalty=’l1’(Lasso)으로 지정할 경우 solver 파라미터를 ‘saga’로 지정해야 한다.) 한편 SVM의 경우 ‘C’, ‘gamma’, ‘kernel’을, Decision Tree의 경우 ‘max_depth’를 주요 초모수로 취급하기로 한다.


```python
# get parameter keys
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
print('Logistic regression keys\n', LogisticRegression().get_params().keys())
from sklearn.svm import SVC
print('\nSVC keys\n', SVC().get_params().keys())
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
print('\nDecision Tree keys\n', DecisionTreeClassifier().get_params().keys())
```

    Logistic regression keys
     dict_keys(['C', 'class_weight', 'dual', 'fit_intercept', 'intercept_scaling', 'l1_ratio', 'max_iter', 'multi_class', 'n_jobs', 'penalty', 'random_state', 'solver', 'tol', 'verbose', 'warm_start'])
    
    SVC keys
     dict_keys(['C', 'break_ties', 'cache_size', 'class_weight', 'coef0', 'decision_function_shape', 'degree', 'gamma', 'kernel', 'max_iter', 'probability', 'random_state', 'shrinking', 'tol', 'verbose'])
    
    Decision Tree keys
     dict_keys(['ccp_alpha', 'class_weight', 'criterion', 'max_depth', 'max_features', 'max_leaf_nodes', 'min_impurity_decrease', 'min_samples_leaf', 'min_samples_split', 'min_weight_fraction_leaf', 'random_state', 'splitter'])


#### step 3. Bayesian optimization을 실행하기 위해 BayesSearchCV()를 호출한다.


```python
from skopt import BayesSearchCV
from skopt.space import Real, Categorical, Integer
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score

# define inner and outer cv 
inner_cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=0)
outer_cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=0)
```

특성변수로부터 와인의 등급을 예측할 때 로지스틱 회귀, SVM, 분류나무 중 어느 모형의 최종 성능이 가장 좋은지 점검하기 위해 train set을 BayesSearchCV에 적용하여 최상의 hyper parameter를 구하고, train set의 accuracy를 nested cross validation으로 구한 test set의 평균 accuracy와 비교하여 과대적합 여부를 판단한다. 이 때 test set의 평균 accuracy가 해당 모형의 성능이다. 

nested cross validation의 경우, outer loop가 5분할이고 inner loop가 3분할인 5-3 cross validation을 이용한다. inner loop는 BayesSearchCV() 함수를 사용하여 초모수를 결정하고 outer loop는 cross_val_score() 함수로 test set의 성능을 점검한다. BayesSearchCV() 함수의 estimator 파라미터를 LogisticRegression의 인스턴스로 지정하고, 다시 cross_val_score() 함수의 estimator를 앞선 BayesSearchCV 인스턴스로 지정하여 중첩 루프를 만들 수 있다. 

한편, 목적변수(와인의 등급)가 범주형이고 모형의 목표가 분류이므로 각 분할(fold) 내 범주 간 비율이 전체 데이터에서의 범주 간 비율과 유사해야 한다. 이를 위해 StratifiedKFold() 함수를 호출하고 shuffle=True로 지정함으로써 자료를 섞고 층화 추출 및 분할하도록 한다. BayesSearchCV(), cross_val_score()의 파라미터인 cv(cross-validation)을 지정할 때StratifiedKFold의 인스턴스를 넘겨준다.


### 1) Logistic regression


```python
# train set에서 최적의 hyper parameter 구하기 

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

param_logit = [{
                'penalty': Categorical(['l1']),
                'solver': Categorical(['saga']),
                'C': Real(1e-4, 1e+4, prior='log-uniform'),
                'max_iter': Integer(100, 15000)
                },
              {
                'penalty': Categorical(['l2']),
                'C': Real(1e-4, 1e+4, prior='log-uniform'),
                'max_iter': Integer(100, 15000)
              }]

bs_logit = BayesSearchCV(estimator=LogisticRegression(),
                        search_spaces=param_logit,
                        scoring='accuracy',
                        cv=inner_cv,
                        verbose=0)

bs_logit.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_estimator = bs_logit.best_estimator_
train_accuracy = best_estimator.score(X_train, y_train)
# train accuracy
print('\n[Logit] Best hyper parameters: ', bs_logit.best_params_)
print('[Logit] Train accuracy: %.3f' % train_accuracy)
```

### 2) SVM

서포트벡터머신은 측도에 민감하므로 먼저 표준화를 한다. pipeline을 만들어 StandardScaler()와 SVC()를 연결하고, 이 pipeline을 BayesSearchCV()의 estimator 파라미터에 넘겨준다. BayesSearchCV()가 탐색하는 초모수는 C, gamma, kernel이다. 


```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# 표준화
pipe_svc = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC())

param_svc = {
    'svc__C': Real(1e-4, 1e+4, prior='log-uniform'),
    'svc__gamma': Real(1e-4, 1e+4, prior='log-uniform'),
    'svc__kernel': Categorical(['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'])
}

bs_svc = BayesSearchCV(estimator = pipe_svc, 
                   search_spaces=param_svc, 
                   scoring='accuracy', 
                   cv=inner_cv)

bs_svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_estimator = bs_svc.best_estimator_
train_accuracy = best_estimator.score(X_train, y_train)

# train accuracy
print('\n[SVM] Best hyper parameters: ', bs_svc.best_params_)
print('[SVM] Train accuracy: %.3f' % train_accuracy)

```

    
    [SVM] Best hyper parameters:  OrderedDict([('svc__C', 161.826560320492), ('svc__gamma', 0.0014726538058788409), ('svc__kernel', 'sigmoid')])
    [SVM] Train accuracy: 1.000



```python
# nested cross validation 

bs_svc = BayesSearchCV(estimator = pipe_svc, 
                   search_spaces=param_svc, 
                   scoring='accuracy', 
                   cv=inner_cv)

scores_svc = cross_val_score(bs_svc, X, y, scoring='accuracy', cv=outer_cv)

# test accuracy
print('[SVC] CV Test accuracy: %.3f ± %.3f' % (np.mean(scores_svc), np.std(scores_svc)))

```

    [SVC] CV Test accuracy: 0.978 ± 0.021


- \[SVM] Best hyper parameters:  OrderedDict(\[('svc__C', 161.826560320492), ('svc__gamma', 0.0014726538058788409), ('svc__kernel', 'sigmoid')])

### 3) CART (Decision Tree)

분류나무의 경우 표준화와 같은 전처리를 요하지 않으므로 별도의 파이프라인을 생성하지 않았다. 분류나무에 대한 BayesSearchCV()의 search_space로는 초모수 max_depth만 지정하였다. 


```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# train set에서 최상의 hyperparameter 구하기
bs_tree = BayesSearchCV(estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0), 
                       search_spaces=[{'max_depth': [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,None]}], 
                       scoring='accuracy', 
                       cv=inner_cv,
                       verbose=0)
bs_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_estimator = bs_tree.best_estimator_
train_accuracy = best_estimator.score(X_train, y_train)

# train accuracy
print('[Tree] Best parameter: ', bs_tree.best_params_)
print('[Tree] Train accuracy: %.3f' % train_accuracy)
```

    [Tree] CV Test set accuracy: 0.933 ± 0.051


- \[Tree] best parameters:  OrderedDict(\[('max_depth', 3)])
- \[Tree] Train accuracy: 1.000
- \[Tree] CV accuracy: 0.933 ± 0.051
- 전체 모형에서의 성능이 다른 모델보다 낮음

---
### 내부루프
- 목적: 초모수 결정
- BayesSearchCV() 함수 사용
### 외곽루프
- 목적: 시험데이터의 성능 점검
- cross_val_score() 함수 사용
- 전체 데이터를 사용해야 다섯개로 분할된 train-test 세트를 만들고, 각 분할(세트) 내에서 train-validation 쌍을 세 개 만들어 BayesSearchCV()를 이용하여 초모수를 결정할 수 있다.

### 위 결과로, SVM<span style="color:darkgray">(0.978 ± 0.021)</span>이 로지스틱 회귀<span style="color:darkgray">(0.950 ± 0.011)</span>나 분류나무<span style="color:darkgray">(0.933 ± 0.051)</span>보다 정밀도가 높게 나타나, 더 우수한 분류모형이라고 할 수 있다.
